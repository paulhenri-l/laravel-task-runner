This tool will help you run a defined set of tasks in your commands. It's useful 
in cases where your commands needs to consequently run different operations.

This tool is used inside both 
[LaravelEngine](https://github.com/paulhenri-l/laravel-engine) and the
[PHL Console](https://github.com/paulhenri-l/console).

## Example

```shell script
php artisan my-command

[Some\Namespace\MyFirstTask]
Hello from MyFirstTask.

[Some\Namespace\MySecondTask]
MySecondTask Complete.

Installation done ðŸŽ‰
```

## Installation

```shell script
composer require paulhenri-l/laravel-task-runner
```

## Usage

In order to use the TaskRunner you need to add the `CanRunTasks` trait to your
command and call the `runTasks` method.

The first argument is the array of tasks you want to run, any argument given
after that will be forwarder to the tasks.

As tasks are resolved through laravel's container so you can type hint any 
dependency you may need in your task's constructor.

### Use the trait

```php
<?php

class FakeCommand extends Illuminate\Console\Command
{
    use PaulhenriL\LaravelTaskRunner\CanRunTasks;

    protected $signature = 'my-command';

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        $this->runTasks([
            MyFirstTask::class,
            MySecondTask::class
        ], $this, 'arument2', 'argumentN...');

        $this->info('Installation done ðŸŽ‰');
    }
}
```

### Writing a task

```php
class MyFirstTask
{
    public function __construct(SomeDependency $someDependency)
    {
        //
    }

    public function __invoke($command, $argument2, $argumentN)
    {
        $command->info('Hello from MyFirstTask.');
    }
}
```

### Stop early

If you want to stop early you only need to return false from your task.


```php
class MySecondTask
{
    public function __invoke()
    {
        if ($thereIsAnError) {
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```
